# Outputs <br />
FHD outputs various data products. We outline and describe these below. <br />

## Beam <br />

### \<obsid\>_beams.sav <br />

**beam_ptr**: A pointer to a pointer array of dimensions N_polarizations x N_beams x N_baselines, which themselves are pointer arrays of dimension N_uvresolution x N_uvresolution to the appropriate hyperresolution uv complex beam model for that particular frequency, polarization, and baseline sampled at the uv resolution. There is a one-pixel offset in the UV resolution for centering purposes
